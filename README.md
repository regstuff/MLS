# NGINX Server

The default login/password for the server is admin/nimda

## Need to install on Ubuntu 16.04

Don't use Ubuntu minimal. Use the regular 16.04 image

## Steps to Install

1. On the terminal, type:
   The installation is automatic, except for the initial part where you need to choose your timezone for time and date configuration.  
    Note: Installation may take up to an hour on a single CPU instance.
1. Once installation is complete, on the terminal, type: `sudo visudo`
1. To the bottom of the file that opens up, add: `www-data ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/bash, /bin/ls`
1. `Ctrl+o` to save the file, `Ctrl+X` to exit the notepad editor. This process is needed to give the `NGINX` server access to the shell scripting.

## Steps to Update

There is no need to install large libraries if you want to just update the source code. In this case, you can run:

```sh
sudo ./update-mls.sh
```

### Uploading Lowerthirds From The Settings

1. If you want to allow uploading of lowerthirds from the settings page, on the terminal, `type: sudo nano /etc/php/7.0/fpm/php.ini`
1. Find the line `;file_uploads = On` â€“> Usually around line 800. `Ctrl+Shift+_` and type 800 to get there quickly.
1. Remove the semicolon in front of the line to uncomment it.
1. `Ctrl+o` to save the file, `Ctrl+X` to exit the notepad editor.

### Optional additional step:

By default, all server logs are cleared on instance boot. This will ensure hardisk space isn't consumed too much. If you wish, you can retain them.

1. On the terminal, type: `sudo nano /etc/init.d/nginxrestart.sh`
1. In the editor, comment on the line (Add # before it): `sudo rm /usr/local/nginx/logs/*.log`
1. `Ctrl+o` to save the file, `Ctrl+X` to exit the notepad editor.
1. Installation is complete!
